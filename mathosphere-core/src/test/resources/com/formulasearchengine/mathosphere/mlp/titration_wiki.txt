==History and etymology==
The word "titration" comes from the Latin word ''titulus'', meaning inscription or title. The French word ''titre'', also from this origin, means rank.

Volumetric analysis originated in late 18th-century France. [[François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles]] ([[:fr:François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles|fr]]) developed the first burette (which was similar to a graduated cylinder) in 1791.<ref>

A major breakthrough in the methodology and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]], who redesigned the burette by placing a clamp and a tip at the bottom, and wrote the first textbook on the topic, ''Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode'' (''Textbook of analytical-chemical titration methods''), published in 1855.<ref>

==Procedure==
[[File:Titration for Soil.JPG|thumb|Analysis of soil samples by titration]]
A typical titration begins with a [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or [[Erlenmeyer flask]] containing a very precise volume of the analyte and a small amount of [[PH indicator|indicator]] (such as [[phenolphthalein]]) placed underneath a calibrated [[burette]] or [[Pipette|chemistry pipetting syringe]] containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold, reflecting arrival at the [[equivalence point|endpoint]] of the titration. Depending on the endpoint desired, single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator. When the endpoint of the reaction is reached, the volume of reactant consumed is measured and used to calculate the concentration of analyte by

:<math>\mathbf{C}_a=\frac{\mathbf{C}_{t}\mathbf{V}_{t}\mathbf{M}}{\mathbf{V}_a}</math>

where '''C'''<sub>a</sub> is the concentration of the analyte, typically in [[molarity]]; '''C'''<sub>t</sub> is the concentration of the titrant, typically in molarity; '''V'''<sub>t</sub> is the volume of the titrant used, typically in liters; '''M''' is the mole ratio of the analyte and reactant from the balanced [[chemical equation]]; and '''V'''<sub>a</sub> is the volume of the analyte used, typically in liters.<ref>

===Preparation techniques===
Typical titrations require titrant and analyte to be in a liquid (solution) form.  Though solids are usually dissolved into an aqueous solution, other solvents such as [[Acetic acid|glacial acetic acid]] or [[ethanol]] are used for special purposes (as in [[petrochemistry]]).<ref>

==Titration curves==
{{main article|Titration curve}}

[[Image:Oxalic acid titration grid.svg|thumb|A typical titration curve of a [[Diprotic acid|diprotic]] acid titrated with a strong base. Shown here is [[oxalic acid]] titrated with [[sodium hydroxide]]. Both equivalence points are visible.]]

A titration curve is a curve in the plane whose ''x''-coordinates are the volume of [[titrant]] added since the beginning of the titration, and whose ''y''-coordinate is the concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration (in an acid–base titration, the ''y''-coordinate is usually the pH of the solution).<ref>

In an [[acid]]–[[base (chemistry)|base]] titration, the titration curve reflects the strength of the corresponding acid and base. For a strong acid and a strong base, the curve will be relatively smooth and very steep near the equivalence point. Because of this, a small change in titrant volume near the equivalence point results in a large pH change and many indicators would be appropriate (for instance [[litmus test|litmus]], [[phenolphthalein]] or [[bromothymol blue]]).

If one reagent is a weak acid or base and the other is a strong acid or base, the titration curve is irregular and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the titration curve for the titration between [[oxalic acid]] (a weak acid) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as [[phenolphthalein]] would be appropriate.  Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as [[methyl orange]] and [[bromothymol blue]] being most appropriate.

Titrations between a weak acid and a weak base have titration curves which are highly irregular. Because of this, no definite indicator may be appropriate and a [[pH meter]] is often used to monitor the reaction.<ref>

The type of function that can be used to describe the curve is called a [[sigmoid function]].

==Types of titrations==
There are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals. The most common types of qualitative titration are [[acid–base titration]]s and [[redox titration]]s.

Acid–base titrations depend on the [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] between an acid and a base when mixed in solution.  In addition to the sample, an appropriate [[pH indicator]] is added to the titration chamber, reflecting the pH range of the equivalence point. The acid–base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color. The endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator. Thus, a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error. For example, if the equivalence point is at a pH of 8.4, then the Phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of Alizarin Yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error. Common indicators, their colors, and the pH range in which they change color are given in the table above.<ref>

For very strong bases, such as [[organolithium reagent]], [[metal amides]], and [[hydride]]s, water is generally not a suitable solvent and indicators whose [[pKa]] are in the range of aqueous pH changes are of little use. Instead, the titrant and indicator used are much weaker acids, and anhydrous solvents such as [[THF]] are used.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scripps.edu/shenvi/Education_files/titration.pdf| title=Titrating Soluble RM, R2NM and ROM Reagents |accessdate= 2014-06-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/gladysz/documents/alkylreagents.pdf |title= Methods for Standardizing Alkyllithium Reagents (literature through 2006) |accessdate= 2014-06-04 }}</ref>


[[File:Faint pink color of Phenolphthalein.jpg|thumb|Phenolphthalein, a commonly used indicator in Acid and Base Titration]]

The approximate pH during titration can be approximated by three kinds of calculations. Before beginning of titration, the concentration of <chem>[H^+]</chem> is calculated in aquesous solution of weak acid before adding any base. When the number of moles  of bases added equals the number of moles of initial acid or so called [[equivalence point]], one of hydrolysis and the pH is calculated in the same way that the conjugate bases of the acid titrated was calculated. Between starting and end points, <chem>[H^+]</chem> is obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbach equation and titration mixture is considered as buffer. In Henderson-Hasselbach equation the <chem>[acid]</chem> and <chem>[base]</chem> are said to be the molarities that would have been present even with dissociation or hydrolysis. In a buffer, <chem>[H^+]</chem> can be exactly calculated but  the dissociation of <chem>HA</chem>, the hydrolysis of <chem>A^-</chem> and the ionization of water must be taken into account.<ref name=Harris>''Quantitative Chemical Analysis, 7Ed.'' by Daniel C.

===Redox titration===
{{Main article|Redox titration}}

Redox titrations are based on a [[redox|reduction-oxidation reaction]] between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. A [[potentiometer]] or a [[redox indicator]] is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration, as when one of the constituents is the oxidizing agent [[potassium dichromate]].  The color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite, therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used.<ref>

===Gas phase titration===
Gas phase titrations are titrations done in the [[gas phase]], specifically as methods for determining reactive species by reaction with an excess of some other gas, acting as the titrant.  In one common gas phase titration, gaseous [[ozone]] is titrated with nitrogen oxide according to the reaction

:O<sub>3</sub> + NO → O<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>

After the reaction is complete, the remaining titrant and product are quantified (e.g., by [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FT-IR]]); this is used to determine the amount of analyte in the original sample.

Gas phase titration has several advantages over simple [[spectrophotometry]].  First, the measurement does not depend on path length, because the same path length is used for the measurement of both the excess titrant and the product.  Second, the measurement does not depend on a linear change in absorbance as a function of analyte concentration as defined by the [[Beer-Lambert law]].  Third, it is useful for samples containing species which interfere at wavelengths typically used for the analyte.<ref>

===Complexometric titration===
{{Main article|Complexometric titration}}

Complexometric titrations rely on the formation of a [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized [[complexometric indicator]]s that form weak complexes with the analyte.  The most common example is the use of [[starch indicator]] to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration, the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone.  Other complexometric indicators are [[Eriochrome Black T]] for the titration of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ions, and the [[chelating agent]] [[EDTA]] used to titrate metal ions in solution.<ref>

===Assay===
{{Main article|Assay|Virus quantification}}

An assay is a form of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a [[virus]] or [[bacterium]].  Serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus. The positive or negative value may be determined by visually inspecting the infected cells under a [[microscope]] or by an immunoenzymetric method such as [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA). This value is known as the [[titer]].<ref>

*Indicator: A substance that changes color in response to a chemical change. An [[pH indicator|acid–base indicator]] (e.g., [[phenolphthalein]]) changes color depending on the pH. [[Redox indicator]]s are also used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the beginning; the endpoint has been reached when the color changes.
*[[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)|Potentiometer]]: An instrument that measures the [[electrode potential]] of the solution.  These are used for redox titrations; the potential of the working electrode will suddenly change as the endpoint is reached.
[[File:PHmeter basic.JPG|thumb|An elementary [[pH meter]] that can be used to monitor titration reactions]]
*[[pH meter]]: A potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H<sup>+</sup> ion present in the solution. (This is an example of an [[ion-selective electrode]].) The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator; at the endpoint there will be a sudden change in the measured pH.
*[[electrical conductivity|Conductivity]]: A measurement of ions in a solution.  Ion concentration can change significantly in a titration, which changes the conductivity. (For instance, during an acid–base titration, the H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> ions react to form neutral H<sub>2</sub>O.) As total conductance depends on all ions present in the solution and not all ions contribute equally (due to [[electrophoretic mobility|mobility]] and [[ionic strength]]), predicting the change in conductivity is more difficult than measuring it.
*Color change: In some reactions, the solution changes color without any added indicator. This is often seen in redox titrations when the different oxidation states of the product and reactant produce different colors.
*[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]]: If a reaction produces a solid, a precipitate will form during the titration. A classic example is the reaction between Ag<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> to form the insoluble salt AgCl. Cloudy precipitates usually make it difficult to determine the endpoint precisely. To compensate, precipitation titrations often have to be done as "back" titrations (see below).
*[[Calorimeter#Isothermal titration calorimeter|Isothermal titration calorimeter]]: An instrument that measures the heat produced or consumed by the reaction to determine the endpoint.  Used in [[biochemistry|biochemical]] titrations, such as the determination of how [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s bind to [[enzyme]]s.
*[[Thermometric Titration|Thermometric titrimetry]]: Differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry because the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the endpoint is determined by ''the rate of temperature change''.
*[[Spectroscopy]]: Used to measure the absorption of light by the solution during titration if the [[spectrum]] of the reactant, titrant or product is known.  The concentration of the material can be determined by [[Beer's Law]].
*[[amperometric titration|Amperometry]]: Measures the current produced by the titration reaction as a result of the oxidation or reduction of the analyte. The endpoint is detected as a change in the current. This method is most useful when the excess titrant can be reduced, as in the titration of [[halide]]s with Ag<sup>+</sup>.

===Endpoint and equivalence point===
Though equivalence point and endpoint are used interchangeably, they are different terms.  ''Equivalence point'' is the theoretical completion of the reaction: the volume of added titrant at which the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte, or some multiple thereof (as in [[polyprotic]] acids).  ''Endpoint'' is what is actually measured, a physical change in the solution as determined by an [[pH indicator|indicator]] or an instrument mentioned above.<ref>

===Back titration===
Back titration is a titration done in reverse; instead of titrating the original sample, a known excess of standard reagent is added to the solution, and the excess is titrated. A back titration is useful if the endpoint of the reverse titration is easier to identify than the endpoint of the normal titration, as with [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] reactions. Back titrations are also useful if the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow, or when the analyte is in a non-[[Solubility|soluble]] solid.<ref>

==Particular uses==
[[File:School level titration demonstration.jpg|thumb|A titration is demonstrated to secondary school students.]]

===Acid–base titrations===

*In [[biodiesel]]: [[Vegetable oil fuel|waste vegetable oil]] (WVO) must be neutralized before a batch may be processed.  A portion of WVO is titrated with a base to determine acidity, so the rest of the batch may be properly neutralized.  This removes [[Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acids]] from the WVO that would normally react to make soap instead of biodiesel.<ref>

*[[Acid value]]: the mass in milligrams of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) required to titrate fully an acid in one gram of sample. An example is the determination of [[Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acid]] content.
*[[Saponification value]]: the mass in milligrams of KOH required to saponify a [[fatty acid]] in one gram of sample. Saponification is used to determine average chain length of fatty acids in fat.
*Ester value (or ester index): a calculated index. Ester value = Saponification value – Acid value.
*Amine value: the mass in milligrams of KOH equal to the [[amine]] content in one gram of sample.
*[[Hydroxyl value]]: the mass in milligrams of KOH corresponding to [[hydroxyl]] groups in one gram of sample. The analyte is [[acetylation|acetylated]] using [[acetic anhydride]] then titrated with KOH.

===Redox titrations===

*[[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]]: Used to determine oxygen concentration in water. Oxygen in water samples is reduced using [[manganese(II) sulfate]], which reacts with [[potassium iodide]] to produce [[iodine]]. The iodine is released in proportion to the oxygen in the sample, thus the oxygen concentration is determined with a redox titration of iodine with [[thiosulfate]] using a starch indicator.<ref>

*[[Benedict's reagent]]: Excess [[glucose]] in urine may indicate [[diabetes]] in the patient.  Benedict's method is the conventional method to quantify glucose in urine using a prepared reagent.  In this titration, glucose reduces [[Copper|cupric]] ions to cuprous ions which react with [[potassium thiocyanate]] to produce a white precipitate, indicating the endpoint.<ref>

*[[Bromine number]]: A measure of [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturation]] in an analyte, expressed in milligrams of bromine absorbed by 100&nbsp;grams of sample.
*[[Iodine number]]: A measure of unsaturation in an analyte, expressed in grams of iodine absorbed by 100&nbsp;grams of sample.

===Miscellaneous===

*[[Karl Fischer titration]]: A potentiometric method to analyze trace amounts of water in a substance. A sample is dissolved in [[methanol]], and titrated with Karl Fischer reagent. The reagent contains iodine, which reacts proportionally with water. Thus, the water content can be determined by monitoring the [[Electric potential|potential]] of excess iodine.<ref>
