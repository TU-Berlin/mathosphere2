In [[mathematics]], '''Jacobi polynomials''' (occasionally called '''hypergeometric polynomials''') {{math|''P''{{su|b=''n''|p=(''α'', ''β'')}}(''x'')}} are a class of [[Classical orthogonal polynomials|classical]] [[orthogonal polynomials]]. They are orthogonal with respect to the weight {{math|(1 − ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}. The [[Gegenbauer polynomials]], and thus also the [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre]], [[Zernike polynomials|Zernike]] and [[Chebyshev polynomials]], are special cases of the Jacobi polynomials.&lt;ref name=sz&gt;{{cite book | last1=Szegő | first1=Gábor | title=Orthogonal Polynomials | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hcW8HBh7gsC | publisher= American Mathematical Society | series=Colloquium Publications | isbn=978-0-8218-1023-1 | mr=0372517 | year=1939 | volume=XXIII|chapter=IV. Jacobi polynomials.}} The definition is in IV.1; the differential equation &amp;ndash; in IV.2; Rodrigues' formula is in IV.3; the generating function is in IV.4; the recurrent relation is in IV.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jacobi polynomials were introduced by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].

And the "''O''" term is uniform on the interval [ε, {{pi}}-ε] for every ε &gt; 0.

==Applications==

The sum extends over all integer values of ''s'' for which the arguments of the factorials are nonnegitive.

A little bit blabla.
